## Vision
Enable anyone (not just Solidity engineers) to create sophisticated, secure DeFi strategies via a visual builder that compiles to battle-tested smart contracts and deploys with one click. Build the marketplace where strategies can be discovered, reused, and monetized.

### Application Context (Solo Founder, No Prior Funding)
This project is currently led by a solo founder without prior funding and without an internal engineering team. Execution relies on open-source components (n8n, OpenZeppelin), public testnets, free tiers, and AI/noâ€‘code tooling. The MVP plan is milestone-based, with costs concentrated at auditable deliverables (e.g., security review) to ensure capital efficiency and verifiable progress.

---

## Key Features
- Visual strategy builder (React Flow) â†’ code generation â†’ one-click deploy
- Uniswap V4 Hooks integration (hook templates, parameters, safety checks)
- Integration-first approach: n8n (workflows), Zapier (triggers), OpenZeppelin (security), Zapper/alternatives (data)
- Basic backtesting and simulation (progressively enhanced)
- Strategy marketplace (v0 in MVP) with reviews and versioning
- AI-assisted code validation and optimization (phased rollout)

---

## Architecture Overview
- Frontend (React + TS): Drag-and-drop builder, template gallery, marketplace UI
- Orchestration (n8n self-hosted): Custom DeFi nodes (UniswapV4Hook, Wallet, Oracle, Gas, TX Builder)
- Backend API (Node + Fastify): Auth, orchestration APIs, templates, marketplace, audit logs
- Smart Contracts (Solidity 0.8.24+): Hook templates using OpenZeppelin libraries, UUPS proxy patterns where required
- Deployment & Ops: OpenZeppelin Defender (relayers, sentinels), CI/CD, monitoring
- Data: Zapper or fallbacks (CoinGecko, DefiLlama, The Graph) for portfolio, prices, and events

---

## MVP Scope (6â€“8 weeks)

### Delivery Model & Resourcing
- Solo founder coordinating build using AI/noâ€‘code and open-source tools.
- Contracting specialized tasks (e.g., security audit) only at the milestone they are needed.
- Transparent evidence at each step (repo updates, hashes of on-chain tx, demo video).
Week 1â€“2:
- Self-host n8n, build 5 core DeFi nodes, embed editor, Sepolia testnet
Week 3â€“4:
- 10 strategy templates, Zapier triggers, Defender integration, alpha (20 users)
Week 5â€“6:
- Zapper/alternatives, basic backtesting, beta (100 users), marketplace v0
Week 7â€“8:
- Hardening, audits pass (no critical), v1.0 public beta

KPIs (6â€“9 months): 100+ beta users, 5k+ executions/month, 95% success rate.

---

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18+, TypeScript, React Flow, Tailwind, Wagmi + Viem
- Backend: Node.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Redis, IPFS, Docker
- Blockchain: Solidity 0.8.24+, Hardhat, Foundry, Create2, The Graph
- Security/Ops: OpenZeppelin (MIT), Defender (relayers/sentinels/autotasks)
- AI/ML (later): OpenAI API, custom models for gas/security recommendations

## Polski â€” Streszczenie
HookBuilder to platforma no-code do tworzenia i automatyzacji strategii DeFi (Uniswap V4 Hooks) z marketplaceâ€™em. Wykorzystujemy podejÅ›cie integracyjne (n8n, Zapier, OpenZeppelin, Zapper), co skraca czas i koszt MVP o 70â€“80% oraz zmniejsza ryzyko. MVP w 6â€“8 tygodni: 10 szablonÃ³w strategii, wdroÅ¼enie na testnecie, marketplace v0, monitoring przez Defender. Szukam grantÃ³w (PARP/NCBR, Polygon), partnerstw i wczesnych uÅ¼ytkownikÃ³w.
