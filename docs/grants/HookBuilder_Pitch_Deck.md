## 🚀 **SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE**

```
HookBuilder
The No-Code Platform for DeFi Automation

"Democratizing DeFi Development, One Hook at a Time"

───────────────────────────────────────
[HookBuilder Platform], Founder & CEO (Solo Founder)
[hookbuilder@proton.me]
August 2025
───────────────────────────────────────

Note (context): Solo founder, no prior funding, no internal engineering team — delivery via AI/no‑code and open‑source components with milestone‑based spend (auditable deliverables).
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Introduce yourself and your background
- Position HookBuilder as the "Shopify of DeFi"
- Emphasize the democratization aspect
- Set the tone: this is about accessibility and empowerment

---

## 📊 **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM**

Note (context): Problem framed to be solvable by a capital‑efficient, solo‑founder approach leveraging AI/no‑code + integrations (n8n, OZ, Zapier).

```
💸 THE $50B OPPORTUNITY TRAPPED BY COMPLEXITY

Current State of DeFi:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  $50B Total Value Locked in DeFi               │
│  80% of LPs want automation (Dune Analytics)   │
│  BUT: Only 5% can build it themselves          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The Barriers:
🔧 Technical Complexity    → Months of development
💰 High Development Cost   → $50K-200K per hook
⏰ Long Time to Market     → 3-6 months minimum
🔐 Security Risks          → $3B lost to exploits in 2023
👥 Developer Shortage      → 4M shortage globally

Result: 95% of DeFi users are locked out of advanced strategies
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Start with the massive market opportunity ($50B)
- Emphasize the contradiction: demand exists but access doesn't
- Use specific numbers to build credibility
- Connect to universal problem: complexity limiting access
- End with the key insight: market failure due to technical barriers

---

## 💡 **SLIDE 3: OUR SOLUTION**

Note (delivery model): Solution is intentionally integration‑first to reduce capex/opex and enable a solo founder to reach MVP in 6–8 weeks using AI/no‑code tooling and open‑source.

```
