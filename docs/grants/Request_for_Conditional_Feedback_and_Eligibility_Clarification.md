# Request for Conditional Feedback and Eligibility Clarification
### HookBuilder — No‑Code Orchestration for Uniswap V4 Hooks (Solo Founder)

Purpose: This short document respectfully requests conditional/iterative feedback instead of an outright rejection. The goal is to confirm eligibility criteria, understand any gaps, and agree on a path to correct them within a defined timeframe and with verifiable deliverables.

We are prepared to adapt scope, evidence, or budget to satisfy your program’s requirements without compromising auditability and capital efficiency.

---

## 1) Applicant Context (Transparency)
- Applicant: Solo founder, no prior funding, no internal engineering team
- Delivery Model: Integration‑first (n8n, OpenZeppelin Defender, Zapier, Polygon), AI/no‑code, milestone‑based budgeting
- Evidence‑first Execution: Each milestone ends with auditable deliverables (repo tag, testnet tx hash, Defender IDs, demo video, test reports, runbooks)

Request: Please confirm if a solo founder model is eligible and whether you require a registered entity at this stage (or before disbursement), as this differs across grant programs.

---

## 2) Current Submission Package (Quick Index)
- One‑Pager + Executive Summary (PL/EN)
- Pitch Deck (Slide 9 includes revised $15k budget by milestones)
- Polygon Village Application Form (with milestones, budget, evidence)
- PARP/NCBR Concept (includes lean $15k variant + full B+R track)
- Integration Feasibility Report
- Business Plan
- Technical Learning Path
- Roadmap (M1–M5, acceptance/evidence criteria)
- POC Evidence (repo tags, RPC tests, testnet TX plan, demo script)
- Reviewer Pack (links designed to verify in ≤3 clicks)

We are ready to add any additional documents you may require (e.g., compliance statements, legal attestations, or specific forms).

## 3) Eligibility & Compliance Checklist — Clarifications Requested
Please indicate for each item whether our current approach is sufficient or whether remediation is needed. If remediation is needed, we request a conditional pathway (what, why, by when), which we commit to delivering with evidence.

A) Applicant Profile
- Solo founder eligibility: [Sufficient / Needs entity / Other]
- KYC/KYB requirements: [Individual / Company / Both]
- Geographic constraints (sanctions, restricted jurisdictions): [Yes/No — details]

B) Budget & Disbursement
- Milestone‑based disbursement acceptable? [Yes/No] 
- Reserve/Buffer allowed (USD 800) with evidence linkage? [Yes/No]
- Deliverable‑linked payment (repo tags, tx hashes, Defender IDs, demos, test reports): [Accepted / Additional proofs needed]
- Currency & modality (crypto vs fiat): [USDC/MATIC/FIAT — details]

C) Technical Evidence
- Testnet on‑chain evidence (tx hash + explorer link): [Sufficient / Require mainnet POC / Other]
- Defender baseline (Relayer/Sentinel/Autotask): [Optional / Required — specify minimum]
- Security posture (use of OZ, audits pre‑mainnet, bug bounty): [Sufficient / Additional commitments required]
- Data provider policy (fallbacks, rate limits): [Sufficient / Provider contract required]

D) IP, Licensing, and Openness
- Planned licensing (MIT for nodes/templates/SDK; source‑available/dual for core): [Compatible / Adjustments needed]
- Template marketplace moderation (governance, “verified” badge, disclaimers): [Sufficient / Add policy details]
- Prior art & timestamping (repo tags, public posts, IPFS/Arweave): [Sufficient / Formal notarization needed]

E) Risk, Legal and User Safety
- Disclaimers (no financial advice), MVP guardrails (limits/whitelists), geo‑restrictions: [Sufficient / Additions needed]
- Data protection & telemetry (minimal, developer‑focused; no PII): [Sufficient / Policy required]

F) Reporting & Communication
- Update cadence (per milestone, 1‑page + links): [Accepted / Different cadence]
- Preferred evidence format (links vs PDFs vs on‑chain refs): [Specify]
- Reviewer access (demo env, read‑only dashboards): [Required?]

---

## 4) Conditional Approval Path — Our Proposal
If gaps are identified, we propose:
- A written remediation plan (1 page) agreeing on criteria and due dates
- All remediations backed by evidence (repo tags, tx hashes, IDs, reports)
- A brief live or recorded demo after remediation to confirm closure
- Budget disbursement only upon acceptance of evidence (your control)

This approach reduces your risk while enabling an iterative, measurable path to compliance.

## 5) Specific Questions to Avoid Rejection Without Explanation
1) Are there any blocking eligibility items (entity, KYC/KYB, geography) that would prevent funding now? If yes, can we remedy them within a defined window?
2) Is the $15,000 milestone structure acceptable as is? If not, which line items or evidences should be adjusted?
3) What is the minimum acceptable set of evidence for the first disbursement (M1) from your perspective?
4) Do you require additional security artifacts at MVP stage (e.g., static analysis report, threat model excerpt, Defender screenshot)?
5) Do you mandate mainnet evidence at MVP, or is testnet sufficient for POC grants?
6) Are there any content or policy requirements for the strategy templates (marketplace) beyond our current moderation and disclaimers?
7) What documentation format and update cadence do you prefer (links vs files, weekly vs per milestone)?
8) Any program‑specific clauses (brand usage, public announcements, co‑marketing) we should plan for?

We will adapt our package immediately upon your guidance and provide all updates with verifiable evidence.

Thank you for considering a conditional/iterative review process in place of an immediate rejection. This improves alignment, reduces grantor risk, and increases the likelihood of a successful outcome.
