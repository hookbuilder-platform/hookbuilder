Proposed plan to increase acceptance odds (1–2 weeks):

1. POC “walking skeleton”

   - Run n8n locally (Docker) and execute a simple workflow: trigger → fetch price from CoinGecko → POST to a mock “execute_strategy” API.
   - On-chain: generate and sign a simple testnet transaction on Sepolia/Polygon (e.g., minimal transfer from a test account) — add the tx hash to README (POC Evidence section).
   - Record a 90–120s Loom: show n8n UI, explain HookBuilder, show the tx hash, brief “how it fits Polygon” narrative.
   - Repo snapshot (git tag + commit hash) as “POC-proof” — referenced in Submission_Package.md.

2. Repository & documentation

   - Add to README: “POC Demo”, “Milestones & Budget by Deliverable”, “Risk & Mitigations”, “POC Evidence” (repo tag, tx hash, Defender IDs).
   - Add /docs/grants/Submission_Package.md with links: deck, one‑pager, video, repo, MVP plan, KPIs, Polygon application form.
   - PUBLICATION CHECKLIST: README (solo status + AI/no‑code model), license (draft), CONTRIBUTING.md (optional), DISCLAIMER (no financial advice).
   - Add a “Public Roadmap & Changelog” (README or /docs/ROADMAP.md) — dated entries with tags; strengthens prior‑art and continuity proof.
   - Add “Security.md” (contact for disclosures, responsible disclosure scope).

3. Applications

   - Polygon Village: emphasize Polygon focus (milestone: chain integration + tests) + updated $15k budget with per‑milestone evidence.
   - PARP/NCBR: use the prepared R&D description; split tasks into work packages (custom nodes, backend API, audits, UX); attach the “Alternative Variant — Lean Grant Track (USD 15k)” as a bridge track.
   - In parallel, submit 1–2 microgrants/hackathons (dated submissions) — reduces risk of “silent rejection” during the review window.

4. Network & references
   - Gather 2–3 LOIs from power users/protocols (short, email is fine) — include in application or as an attachment.
   - Post once in the n8n community and open one issue/feedback request about custom DeFi nodes (link to POC).
   - Reach out to OZ Defender (trial/best practices) — ask for a reference or a guidance note to attach.
   - Secure public prior‑art:
     • A dated post on X/LinkedIn/GitHub Discussions (concept summary, mocks, POC video link).  
     • Optionally a verifiable timestamp (e.g., Arweave/IPFS hash of Submission_Package.md).
   
Additionally;
   - Add marketplace governance for strategy templates and a moderation policy (content curation and EULA with disclaimers), template versioning (semver), and a “verified” badge after review.
   - Add an “IP & Prior Art” section (in Submission_Package.md): links to public timestamps (repo tags, posts, IPFS hash) and a brief uniqueness statement (no‑code for Uniswap V4 hooks + marketplace).

   1:1 mapping to MVP milestones (from grant docs)
   - For each week/month, indicate which milestones and deliverables (from the Polygon $15k plan) it unlocks. E.g., Month 3 → M2 (contracts + workflow exec), Month 4 → M4 (data/backtesting), etc.
   - Add to Technical_Learning_Path.md a small cross‑map table (Month/Week → Milestone → Evidence).
   - Include “Deliverables Acceptance Criteria” (per milestone): minimal completion criteria + example evidence links.

   “Operational Readiness” section
   - Short runbooks: how to reproduce the environment (n8n docker compose, testnet RPC/keys, Defender onboarding).
   - Versioning & compatibility policy (n8n custom nodes, contracts, data adapters) + an automatic compatibility smoke test after updates.
   - Minimal SLO/Metrics: workflow exec time, success rate, MTTR; a small dashboard with core metrics (grafana/loki optional).
   - Solo “Bus Factor” mitigation: operational checklists, recovery runbook (recreate the environment in 1h), backups of configs (Defender, RPC) and secrets in a password manager.

   QA and UAT
   - e2e test plan (Playwright/Cypress light) for three scenarios: deploy hook, trigger strategy, monitoring.
   - Seed scripts for quick data/test reproduction.
   - “Definition of Done” for each milestone (checklist: code, tests, evidence, docs, video).
   - “Reviewer Pack” for the grantor: a single link to Submission_Package.md with a compact index (POC video, repo tag, tx hashes, Defender IDs, roadmap, $15k budget) — max 3 clicks to fully verify.

Final recommendation

- Ensure SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md links to:
  - README (Evidence Quick Links)
  - POC_EVIDENCE.md (with a live hash after the TX is executed)
  - Loom video (public link)
  - “poc‑v1” tag
  - Defender IDs/screenshots (if baseline configured; optional)
  - Pinned: Roadmap.md and the $15k budget (M1–M5) summary

  6) “Reviewer Pack Validation” — final checklist (status)
- Live testnet tx hash: missing → provide after executing TX (create-testnet-transaction.js is ready).
- Loom 90–120s: script exists (tests/demo-script.md) → record and add the link.
- Repo tag “poc‑v1”: README declares tags/versions → ensure it exists and is linked (e.g., v0.1.1).
- Test outputs for POC_EVIDENCE: fresh logs from test-ethereum-rpc.js and test-n8n-node.js (after fixing the ‘.repeat’ runtime issue) → paste as short JSON/screenshot blocks.
- M1–M5 consistency: looks good; add “Acceptance Criteria” per milestone (in Roadmap or here — already present; mirror the summary into Roadmap.md).

- The package is 80–90% “grant‑ready” and well prepared. The biggest missing piece is a live testnet transaction hash (and a short Loom). After adding those and running the tests (capturing outputs), your “Reviewer Pack” will be complete and verifiable in 2–3 clicks — maximizing acceptance chances.
- Before recording, fix the minor CLI separator logs ('.repeat') so the scripts run without noise — runtime only, not content.

Next operational steps:

1. Execute a 0.001 ETH testnet TX on Sepolia (with data) per create-testnet-transaction.js; copy the hash into README and POC_EVIDENCE.md.
2. Run test-ethereum-rpc.js and test-n8n-node.js, capture outputs (evidence JSON / result.json), add to POC_EVIDENCE.md.
3. Record Loom per demo-script.md; paste the link into Submission_Package.md and README (Evidence Quick Links).
4. Verify Submission_Package.md has complete links, and Roadmap.md includes “Evidence per milestone” and DoD summary.
5. Submit to Polygon Village ($15k) the same day — the package will be “proof‑complete”.
