🧾 Polygon Village Grant Application – HookBuilder (Solo Developer)
🧠 1. Project Summary (Elevator Pitch)

HookBuilder is a visual, no-code automation platform for decentralized finance. It allows users to orchestrate DeFi strategies using integrations with tools like Uniswap V4 Hooks, Zapier, n8n, and OpenZeppelin Defender.

Rather than building a new protocol, HookBuilder serves as the middleware orchestration layer between existing tools – enabling non-technical users, DAOs, and developers to build smart, programmable on-chain logic visually.

Applicant context: Solo founder with no prior funding and no internal engineering team. Delivery is integration‑first with AI/no‑code tooling and open‑source components, using milestone‑based budgeting tied to auditable deliverables (e.g., tx hashes, repo tags, audit reports).
🎯 2. Why are you building this on Polygon?

Polygon is the perfect home for HookBuilder because:

    Its low gas fees enable cost-efficient automation and strategy iteration

    Polygon PoS and zkEVM provide the scalability needed for smart contract orchestration at scale

    Polygon's vibrant ecosystem supports DeFi protocols, DAO tooling, and no-code adoption

    Strategic alignment with Polygon's mission to mainstream Web3 usability

Solo‑friendly: Polygon’s tooling, documentation, and grants ecosystem are particularly supportive for solo builders shipping POC→MVP quickly with measurable on‑chain evidence.

HookBuilder aims to become a core DeFi UX layer – and Polygon is ideal for accessible and composable smart contract logic.
🧰 3. What have you built so far?

Development to date includes:

    Initial architecture and PoC using n8n + custom blockchain nodes

    Integration sketches for Uniswap V4 Hook deployment via visual UI

    Research into smart contract orchestration via OpenZeppelin Defender

    Created pitch deck and detailed grant-ready technical report (see below)

📍 4. What do you plan to build with Polygon funding?

With Polygon support, I will (milestone‑based, auditable deliverables):

    Finalize and publish a working MVP (Q4 2024 / adjust to current quarter)
    • Evidence: repo tags, demo video, Sepolia/Polygon testnet tx hashes

    Implement smart contract logic for strategy templates + hook deployment
    • Evidence: contracts repo, unit tests, deployment scripts, Defender config

    Integrate Polygon PoS and zkEVM for live testing
    • Evidence: deployed addresses, runbooks, test reports

    Launch a beta version with visual editor and test strategies
    • Evidence: invite list, analytics snapshot, user feedback summary

    Grow a community of DeFi builders using Polygon via no-code UX
    • Evidence: tutorials, templates library, Discord metrics

- Reserve used only with explicit linkage to milestone deliverables.
👤 6. Who are you?

    Solo founder with product/DeFi background; leveraging AI/no‑code and open‑source to execute efficiently
    Experience coordinating protocol integrations and automation (Zapier/n8n)
    Focus on interoperability, security by design, and modular architecture
    Community‑oriented approach (docs, tutorials, open templates)
    Plan: progressively open‑source and enable DAO‑friendly contribution model

🧱 7. Tech Stack

    Frontend: React + Tailwind + embedded n8n editor
    Automation: Custom n8n workflows, Zapier webhooks
    Smart Contracts: Solidity + Uniswap V4 Hooks + OpenZeppelin
    Security & Observability: OpenZeppelin Defender + monitoring hooks
    Chain: Polygon PoS, zkEVM (via ethers.js + viem)

Notes for solo execution:
    • Prefer upstreamed OSS where possible to reduce maintenance burden
    • Use free/low‑cost tiers; defer paid infra until post‑beta
    • Keep infra as code + runbooks for transparency and repeatability
