 Polygon Village Grant Application – HookBuilder (Solo Developer)
1. Project Summary (Elevator Pitch)

HookBuilder is a visual, no-code automation platform for decentralized finance. It allows users to orchestrate DeFi strategies using integrations with tools like Uniswap V4 Hooks, Zapier, n8n, and OpenZeppelin Defender.
Rather than building a new protocol, HookBuilder serves as the middleware orchestration layer between existing tools – enabling non-technical users, DAOs, and developers to build smart, programmable on-chain logic visually.
Applicant context: Solo founder with no prior funding and no internal engineering team. Delivery is integration‑first with AI/no‑code tooling and open‑source components, using milestone‑based budgeting tied to auditable deliverables (e.g., tx hashes, repo tags, audit reports).

2. Why are you building this on Polygon?
Polygon is the perfect home for HookBuilder because:
    Its low gas fees enable cost-efficient automation and strategy iteration
    Polygon PoS and zkEVM provide the scalability needed for smart contract orchestration at scale
    Polygon's vibrant ecosystem supports DeFi protocols, DAO tooling, and no-code adoption
    Strategic alignment with Polygon's mission to mainstream Web3 usability
Solo‑friendly: Polygon’s tooling, documentation, and grants ecosystem are particularly supportive for solo builders shipping POC→MVP quickly with measurable on‑chain evidence.

HookBuilder aims to become a core DeFi UX layer – and Polygon is ideal for accessible and composable smart contract logic.

4. What do you plan to build with Polygon funding?

With Polygon support, I will (milestone‑based, auditable deliverables):
    Finalize and publish a working MVP (Q4 2024 / adjust to current quarter)
    • Evidence: repo tags, demo video, Sepolia/Polygon testnet tx hashes
    Implement smart contract logic for strategy templates + hook deployment
    • Evidence: contracts repo, unit tests, deployment scripts, Defender config
    Integrate Polygon PoS and zkEVM for live testing
    • Evidence: deployed addresses, runbooks, test reports
    Launch a beta version with visual editor and test strategies
    • Evidence: invite list, analytics snapshot, user feedback summary
    Grow a community of DeFi builders using Polygon via no-code UX
    • Evidence: tutorials, templates library, Discord metrics

6. Who are you?
- Solo founder with product/DeFi background; leveraging AI/no‑code and open‑source to execute efficiently
- Experience coordinating protocol integrations and automation (Zapier/n8n)
- Focus on interoperability, security by design, and modular architecture
- Community‑oriented approach (docs, tutorials, open templates)

Notes for solo execution:
- Prefer upstreamed OSS where possible to reduce maintenance burden
- Use free/low‑cost tiers; defer paid infra until post‑beta
