- **ACHIEVED (August 5, 2025)**: Multi-chain DeFi automation platform operational
  - **Live Workflow**: `Multi-Chain DeFi Portfolio Monitor.json` - complete n8n automation
  - **Multi-Chain Integration**: Ethereum + Polygon + Sepolia RPC connectivity

- Outsourcing: Critical specialist tasks (e.g., smart‑contract audit, security hardening) engaged precisely at the milestone they are required.

HookBuilder is a modular, integration-first platform enabling users to build, execute, and share automated DeFi strategies by combining leading ecosystem tools such as Uniswap V4 Hooks, n8n, Zapier, OpenZeppelin, and data providers like Zapper.
Instead of building yet another protocol, HookBuilder becomes the middleware and orchestration layer between existing components. This reduces technical risk, cost, and time-to-market while enabling secure, visual automation for DeFi users and developers.

2. Main Objective of the Project
The aim is to develop an MVP platform enabling non-technical and technical users to automate decentralized finance (DeFi) operations via a secure, no-code workflow editor integrated with programmable smart contracts and ecosystem APIs.

This includes:
- Designing and implementing custom blockchain nodes for n8n
- Enabling deployment and control of Uniswap V4 hooks via visual workflows
- Integrating external triggers (Zapier) and on-chain data feeds (Zapper, The Graph)
- Ensuring smart contract security and observability via OpenZeppelin Defender
- Operating as a solo founder leveraging AI/no-code and open‑source to minimize time-to-MVP and capex/opex, with milestone-based verification and reporting.

3. Type of Innovation
- Innovation Type Description
- Technological:Middleware automation layer tailored to blockchain logic and DeFi protocols
- Process: Visual orchestration of smart contract deployments and on-chain strategies
- Business: Strategy marketplace and monetization model for DeFi logic sharing

4. Project Implementation Plan
Delivery Model & Milestone-Based Budgeting
- Solo founder executes core integration and orchestration work using AI/no‑code and open‑source stacks, minimizing fixed costs.
- External contractors engaged only at specific milestones (e.g., pre‑mainnet security audits, formal verification).
- Każdy etap zakończony mierzalnym dowodem (repo commit, hash transakcji, raport testów, demo video) — ułatwia rozliczenie i ewaluację B+R.

- Smart contract backend and testnet integration Basic execution layer for hooks and strategies + Sepolia tx hashes
- Prototyping of frontend orchestration interface Embedded visual builder in React frontend + minimal demo
- Security framework setup	Defender configuration, MIT-licensed libraries + initial threat model
- Deliverable: MVP capable of building and executing testnet strategies with UI editor and API integrations. Evidence includes repository tags, transaction hashes, - test reports, and demo recording.

Phase 2: Pilot & Pre-Commercialization (Months 5–8)
Activity Output:
- API integrations (Zapper, CoinGecko fallback)	Portfolio tracking, token data, alerts + rate-limit monitoring
- Smart contract audits & UX testing External audit report (no critical) + UX test summary
- Alpha & beta testing with users Feedback from 20–100 DeFi users + usage analytics
- Marketplace + workflow templates User-contributed logic, sharing mechanisms + moderation policy
- Growth integrations Multi-chain expansion (Polygon, Arbitrum, Base) + deployment runbooks
- Deliverable: Pre-commercial platform with beta user base and scalable integrations.

5. Estimated Budget

7. Risks & Mitigation
Resource Constraint (Solo Founder)
- Risk: Limited bandwidth may slow parallel workstreams.
- Mitigation: Strict prioritization on integration-first MVP; leverage AI/no‑code to accelerate; engage contractors only for critical-path items at defined milestones.

Risk Mitigation Strategy:
- Zapper API pricing or deprecation - Use fallback providers (CoinGecko, DefiLlama, The Graph)
- n8n customization challenges - Start minimal, engage open-source community
- Smart contract security flaws - Rely on OpenZeppelin libraries and Defender monitoring
- Low initial adoption - Leverage Zapier + Uniswap partnerships + targeted alpha

8. KPIs & Expected Outcomes:
- Metric Target (within 6–9 months)
- Time-to-deploy DeFi strategy (<10 minutes)
- Custom strategy executions/month (>5,000)
- Active beta users	(>100)
- Smart contract audit issues - 0 critical
- Average workflow success rate	(>95%)
- Partner integration rating (>4.5/5)

9. Sustainability & Scalability:
- Revenue model: SaaS plans, marketplace commission, enterprise licensing
- Scalability: Designed modularly — new DeFi nodes can be added with minimal effort
- Openness: Built on open-source tools (n8n, OpenZeppelin), promoting ecosystem collaboration
- Environmental: Serverless, efficient computing model with minimal resource load

10. Project Owner Profile
