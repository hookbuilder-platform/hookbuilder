Yes — we already have roadmap elements spread across multiple files (Before.md: 1–2 week checklist, Polygon_Vilage_Application_Form.md: milestones M1–M5 with budget and evidence, One‑Pager: 6–8 week timeline, Technical_Learning_Path: month-by-month skills). Below is a consolidated, step‑by‑step build roadmap from zero to beta, with explicit artifacts/evidence.

Phase 0: Setup & Repository (1–2 days)

- Initialize the repo (monorepo or separate front/back). Add basics: README with “POC Evidence” and “Milestones & Budget by Deliverable”, LICENSE (draft), SECURITY.md, DISCLAIMER, .editorconfig, CI placeholder.
- Scaffold Vite + React + TS + Tailwind; create folder structure (frontend, backend, workflows, contracts, docs).
- Evidence: initial tag v0.0.1, repo structure screenshot, CI “hello”.

Phase 1 (M1): Orchestration + Polygon Integration (5–7 days)

1. n8n self‑host (Docker) + minimal CI

   - docker‑compose.yml, basic config, healthcheck.
   - Evidence: docker up logs, README run section, tag v0.1.0.

2. Custom nodes v1 (3): Wallet, PriceOracle (CoinGecko/DefiLlama), TxBuilder

   - Each as a separate package with README and examples.
   - Evidence: node packages, sample workflow JSON, short demo video.

3. Polygon PoS/zkEVM integration in nodes + sample workflow

   - RPC provider (free tier), env handling, simple read/write test.
   - Evidence: workflow JSON, saved outputs/execution trace.

4. “Walking skeleton” POC

   - n8n: trigger → fetch price → decision → execute_strategy (mock or simple contract).
   - On‑chain: 1 testnet transaction (Polygon/Sepolia) linked in README.
   - Record a 90–120s Loom (per script).
   - Evidence: tx hash, Loom, repo tag v0.1.1.

Phase 2 (M2): Contracts + Workflow Execution (7–10 days)

1. Hook templates (Solidity) + tests (Hardhat/Foundry)

   - Minimal templates, unit tests, coverage report.
   - Evidence: contracts + tests, coverage report, tag v0.2.0.

2. Deployment scripts (Create2 if sensible) + viem/ethers

   - Deployment scripts, deployment runbook, testnet addresses.
   - Evidence: deployed addresses, runbook, tag v0.2.1.

3. n8n → contracts (execute from workflow)

   - Signing/invocation node, basic error/retry handling.
   - Evidence: workflow JSON + successful tx hashes, logs, tag v0.2.2.

4. Defender baseline (relayer/sentinel/autotask)

   - Minimal configuration for monitoring and execution.
   - Evidence: Defender IDs/log screenshots, tag v0.2.3.

5. QA: initial gas profiling and smoke run

   - Basic gas report + observations.
   - Evidence: QA report, tag v0.2.4.

Phase 3 (M3): UI Builder + Deploy Flow (alpha) (7–9 days)

1. Canvas builder (React Flow) MVP

   - Core blocks, connections, JSON serialization.
   - Evidence: UI demo video, screenshots, tag v0.3.0.

2. Template gallery (≥5 strategies) + parameterization

   - Predefined templates, param forms, validation.
   - Evidence: template list + JSONs, tag v0.3.1.

3. Deploy wizard

   - Steps: network, params, sign, monitor.
   - Evidence: recorded flow, E2E on testnet, tag v0.3.2.

4. UX copy + basic validation

   - Texts, error messages, loading states.
   - Evidence: UX checklist, tag v0.3.3.

5. e2e smoke (Playwright/Cypress light)

   - Three scenarios: deploy hook, trigger strategy, monitor.
   - Evidence: test report, tag v0.3.4.

Phase 4 (M4): Data Integrations + Basic Backtesting (5–7 days)

1. Adapters: CoinGecko/DefiLlama + fallback

   - Provider abstraction layer.
   - Evidence: adapter repo + tests, tag v0.4.0.

2. Basic backtesting

   - Historical fetch, simple signal simulation.
   - Evidence: results/snapshots, tag v0.4.1.

3. Minimal telemetry

   - Events, errors, simple dev dashboard (Grafana/Loki optional).
   - Evidence: dashboard screenshots, tag v0.4.2.

4. Additional 2 nodes (GasTracker, PriceAlert)
   - Evidence: packages + example workflows, tag v0.4.3.

Phase 5 (M5): Beta + Materials + Community (4–6 days)

1. Onboarding guide + 2 tutorials (text + Loom)

   - “First hook deploy”, “First strategy”.
   - Evidence: tutorial links, tag v0.5.0.

2. 10 alpha/beta users

   - Structured feedback (form/Issue template).
   - Evidence: feedback sheet + synthesis, tag v0.5.1.

3. Strategy templates v0 (≥5)

   - Polished metadata, versioning policy.
   - Evidence: template listing, tag v0.5.2.

4. Optimization/bugfix buffer
   - Evidence: changelog, tag v0.5.3.

Cross‑cutting artifacts and “legitimacy”

- Submission_Package.md: single index to deck, one‑pager, Polygon form, README, Loom, tags, hashes, Defender IDs, roadmap, $15k budget, LOIs.
- Public Roadmap & Changelog: dated entries, commit/tag proofs.
- IP & Prior Art: links to public timestamps (X/LinkedIn/GH Discussions, IPFS/Arweave hash).
- Security.md + DISCLAIMER + minimal SLO (success rate, MTTR).
- Deliverables Acceptance Criteria: per milestone (DoD: code, tests, evidence, docs, video).

Where to start tomorrow — Day 1–2:

- Repo bootstrap + docker‑compose for n8n + Vite React TS skeleton + README sections + SECURITY/DISCLAIMER.
- Create Submission_Package.md (empty index).
- Tag v0.0.1. Day 3–5:
- 3 custom nodes (Wallet, PriceOracle, TxBuilder) + sample workflow + first Loom POC.
- Testnet tx hash + README “POC Evidence”.
- Tag v0.1.1.

This is a detailed, step‑by‑step roadmap consolidating all existing documents. Completing it gives you a complete, grant‑ready package with operational readiness and prior‑art defensibility.
